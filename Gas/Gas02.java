/*
 * Problem:Gas Station of leetcode
 * There are N gas stations along a circular route,
 * where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].
 * You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it
 * costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to 
 * its next station (i+1). You begin the journey 
 * with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
 * Return the starting gas stationâ€™s index if you 
 * can travel around the circuit once, otherwise 
 * return -1.Note: The solution is guaranteed to be unique.
